## aweSOM



__aweSOM__ is an R package offering a set of tools to explore and analyze datasets with Self-Organizing Maps (also known as [Kohonen maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map)), a form of artificial neural network originally created by [Teuvo Kohonen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teuvo_Kohonen) in the 1980s. The package introduces interactive plots, making analysis of the SOM easier.

__aweSOM__ provides a variety of functions to analyze and visualize SOMs. They can be used either through the web-based interface (called by ```aweSOM()```) or through command-line functions. The package relies on the ```kohonen``` package for the training of SOMs.
