A to-do-list based on past conversations on what is remaining for the first, stable release


Data Import
.

Train
.


Plots
* boxplot contours and whiskers do not show (Jan)
* Julien: rename arguments


Clustered Data
.

Reproducible Scripts: 
.

Vignette




Other: 
* Help-Message Text and export to an external file (current places of Help Messages: Advanced Options for Training SOM. Are there other spots, maybe the visualization settings for 'contrast' etc.?) (@Julien: Agree to exporting these to txt file?)
* Roxygen Skeletons functions (I'll finish these tonight, (also for the vignette) by inserting some info on the function arguments)
* (Julien) Clean code, and make CRAN-ready
* Remove unused packages from DESCRIPTION (tidyverse? Jan: I'll check, don't think we need it anymore, otherwise I'll specify which package)

For later?
* neighbourhood distance is based on means?!
* line hex plot : circles are a bit above the line (Jan: yes, I'm fixing this hopefully soon, should not be too much work)
