A to-do-list based on past conversations on what is remaining for the first, stable release


Data Import
.

Train
.


Plots
* display the legend
* Reverse-order issue for rectangular grid
* Julien : check "contrast" options for boxplot (doesn't seem to change anything)
* Julien : prototype value rescale ; probably linked to black "Color" plot for prototypes
* Julien : static map download
* boxplot contours and whiskers do not show


Clustered Data
.

Reproducible Scripts: 
.

Vignette
* Describing what the functions do and how the package works (Jan: I can create a first draft)


Other: 
* Help-Message Text and export to an external file (current places of Help Messages: Advanced Options for Training SOM. Are there other spots, maybe the visualization settings for 'contrast' etc.?)
* UI Panel Element for Meta Information?
* Roxygen Skeletons functions
* (Julien) Clean code, and make CRAN-ready
