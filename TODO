TO-DO LIST WITH FOCUS ON A FIRST PUBLICATION


--> Implement the export feature for JS plots --> DONE
--> order of hex/square cells to change from right-->left + top --> bottom to the opposite (-->  start at no.1 on the bottom left and then go towards the right) --> (see exported_version_2 for code to solve this, is that sufficient?)
--> highlight effect for boxplots --> DONE
--> line-plot point selection issues with empty cells --> DONE
--> hitmap mouse-over --> DONE
--> height issues with the barplot (square) --> DONE
--> --> prototype datatype and third contrast option for all variations (Wednesday) -->DONE





--> (w/ Julien) check the remaining bugs in shinymeta caused by observers and the message function for trained SOM
--> Screeplot for PAM clustering and silhouette for hierarchical clustering
--> polygon plot for distance between prototypes/observations mean/median values
--> placement of hex-cells (compared to Kohonen package)
--> improved filename for download (add a timestamp) (Wednesday)
--> Boxplots & barplot : change geometry (fatter bars, square bar to max .95, bar 0 = 0...): design issues basically. 
          highlight function for more variables... (Wednesday)
--> save as .svg file
--> hex grid on pca initialization ? make a hex grid instead of square grid (which is default) when initilaizing neurons on the grid     ,line 459 in server.R (old version) (Wednesday)
--> plot download faster (e.g. boxplot is slow)
--> Starplot/radar chart: check the entire starplot issue: those outside the cells are sometie the zero values. values do not align with other plots. also problem if grid is 1d. 
--> a legend for colors 



MORE OF A WISHLIST.....





--> save R session function

--> 3d plots: what would the 3rd dimension be? see email, can be done with basic R. Probelms with hex. structures needs to be found. 
--> intra-cell variance plot ? the one we spoke about in our last call? R or JS? 
--> new graph e.g. color plot. with color corresponding to intra cell variance. how diverse are observations in each cell. R            feasible. call with variance data.  
--> Super class graph options : none, background, foreground? --> be able to forget super classes --> not display them at all. Now      they are always indicated by background color. For some graphs could make sense to make it foreground color e.g. for hitmap         squares as forground color. not too urgent. 
--> scatterplot (2 var) par cellule, common scale? scatter plot for two selected numeric variabels for each cell as point.
--> flip and rotate
